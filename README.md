# Task Description

Creating a 30-minute interview task for Angular 2+ can be quite effective in evaluating a candidate's understanding and practical skills in this framework, For a balanced approach, the task should encompass various aspects of Angular, including components, services, data binding, and Angular- specific features like Directives or Decorators.

Here's an outline for a 30-minute interview taski

# Task: User Profile Management Application

- It's okay if you don't complete everything; prioritize quality and best practices over quantity. 
  
- Explain your thought process and decisions as you work through the task.

# Conclusions

This task assesses a range of skills, from basic Angular concepts to more advanced practices like reactive forms and change detection strategies. It's also open-ended enough to allow candidates with different levels of expertise to showcase their skills. The interviewer can gauge the candidate's

proficiency in Angular based on how they approach the problem, the solutions they implement, and how

they handle the various aspects of the framework.



## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
